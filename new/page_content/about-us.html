                <p>Every student is unique. The right education is the foundation for a better future of a school
                    student. At Bright Brains Academy, students get personalized tutoring. Education cannot be “one size
                    fits all.” It is imperative to get to know the child, his strengths, and weaknesses, and only then
                    customize our solutions to your child’s unique requirements. This is where Bright Brains Academy
                    makes a difference. Our tailored education software shares a questionnaire with the students based
                    on their curriculum. Depending on the answers, their assessment, and evaluation, every student will
                    be provided with customized tutoring by certified and professional teachers.</p>
